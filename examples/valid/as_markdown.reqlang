# Request Files Are Markdown Files

Anything outside of the config, request, or response code blocks is treated as markdown. This lets you document your request files in a way that is easy to read and understand.

## Config

Prompt the user for the `status_code` to return.

```%config
[prompts]
# Status code the response will return
status_code = ""
```

## Request

This will respond with the prompted `status_code`.

```%request
GET https://httpbin.org/status/{{?status_code}} HTTP/1.1
```
