# Request File As Markdown

- Request files are also markdown files.
- [Configuration](#config), [Request](#request), and [Response](#response) are defined using code blocks.
- Everything else is considered a comment.

## Config

Use a `%config` code block to define the configuration.

```%config
[prompts]
# Status code the response will return
status_code = ""
```

## Request

Use a `%request` code block to define the request.

```%request
GET https://httpbin.org/status/{{?status_code}} HTTP/1.1
```

## Response

Use a `%response` code block to define the response.

```%response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```
