# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports and feature requests to code contributions and documentation improvements. This document outlines how to get started.

## Navigating the Project

- [**`assert-response`**](./assert-response/): Library for asserting responses against expected responses.
- [**`cli`**](./cli/): A CLI for interacting with request files from the terminal.
- [**`diagnostics`**](./diagnostics/): Contains diagnostic functionality, which helps you identify issues in your request files and provide feedback on how to fix them.
- [**`errors`**](./errors/): A library of shared Rust error types that can be used across the project.
- [**`examples`**](./examples/): Valid and invalid request files. Designed to illustrate the format's features. Also used when running the [integration tests](./integration-tests/).
- [**errors**](./errors): Shared errors used by Reqlang
- [**`extract-codeblocks`**](./extract-codeblocks/): Library for extracting code blocks from markdown strings. This is used for parsing the request, response, and config from request files.
- [**`integration-tests`**](./integration-tests/): Test suite that parses the [example](./examples/) request files.
- [**`parser`**](./parser/): A library for parsing, validating, and templating request files.
- [**`reqlang`**](./reqlang/): Primary library for handling request files. Re-exports structs, enums, functions from other crates.
- [**`reqlang-client`**](./reqlang-client/): A simple desktop GUI applicationfor testing and demonstration purposes.
- [**`reqlang-fetch`**](./reqlang-fetch/): A library of traits for executing requests from request files.
- [**`reqlang-lsp`**](./reqlang-lsp/): The reqlang language server. Used by the VS Code [extension](./vsc/).
- [**`span`**](./span/): A library of types for handling spanned values when parisng request files.
- [**`str-idxpos`**](./str-idxpos/): A utility library for handling string indices and positions.
- [**`types`**](./types/): A library for defining shared data types used across the project, managing the structure of request files, configurations, and response data. It uses `serde` for serialization/deserialization, making it possible to interact with external tools easily.
- [**`vsc`**](./vsc/): The VS Code extension for working with request files. It also acts as a client for executing requests.
